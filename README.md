# VINYL EXCHANGE

## About
A marketplace for vinyl enthusiasts to buy and sell records. Add your vinyls for sale and every other user will be able to buy them. Or buy the vinyls that someone else has posted.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the application

Make sure Ruby is installed

```
ruby -v
```

Make sure Rails is installed

```
rails -v
```

## Installing:
A step by step guide how to get a development env running

Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:marynavoitenko/vinyl-exchange-v2-jquery.git
```

Install all dependencies

```
bundle install
```

Create db and migrate schema

```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

Now run the application

```
rails s
```

### Facebook Login
To make it work on localhost, you need to generate a self-signed SSL certificate

Make sure you're inside the app directory (or move the files there later)

```
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt
```

This will create localhost.key and localhost.crt files.

To run rails server using a generated self-signed SSL certificate

```
rails s -b 'ssl://localhost:3000?key=localhost.key&cert=localhost.crt'
```
